# wireframing

## Description
**Wireframing** is a visual representation of a website, app, or digital product's layout and structure. It serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework that outlines the placement of elements like buttons, menus, images, and textâ€”without detailed design (colors, fonts, etc.).<br>

Benefits:
- Saves time by identifying issues early.
- Improves communication among teams.
- Guides the UX/UI design process before visual styling.
