# wireframing

## Description
**Wireframing** is a visual representation of a website, app, or digital product's layout and structure. It serves as a blueprint or skeletal framework that outlines the placement of elements like buttons, menus, images, and textâ€”without detailed design (colors, fonts, etc.).<br>

**Benefits:**
- Saves time by identifying issues early.
- Improves communication among teams.
- Guides the UX/UI design process before visual styling.

## Key Elements
**1. Layout Structure**
- **What it is:** The foundational grid or arrangement of components on a screen (e.g., header, footer, columns, sidebars).
- **Purpose:** Ensures logical organization and visual hierarchy.<br>

**Examples**:
- A 3-column layout for a news homepage.
- A centered single-column form for a login screen.

**2. Navigation**
- **What it is:** How users move through the product (menus, buttons, links).
- **Purpose:** Guides users intuitively and reduces friction.

**Examples:**
- A top navigation bar with dropdown menus.
- A hamburger menu for mobile layouts.
- Breadcrumbs or back buttons for multi-step processes.

**3. Content Placement**
- **What it is:** Positioning of text, images, videos, and other media.
- **Purpose:** Balances readability and engagement.

**Examples:**
- Headline at the top, body text below, CTA button at the bottom.
- Image carousels above product descriptions.

**4. Functionality**
- **What it is:** Interactive elements and their behavior (without full coding).
- **Purpose:** Clarifies how features will work.

**Examples:**
- A search bar with auto-suggestions.
- Radio buttons for filters in an e-commerce app.
- Hover effects or clickable areas (often noted with annotations).
